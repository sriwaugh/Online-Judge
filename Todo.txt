Planning to rebuild this from scratch...
building a separate interface for adding problems, viewing scores etc...
Build a score board
Build a contest page



Admin can create contest and can add set of problems. Also grab a good set of probs from Codeforces (us CF api)
After setting the contest, students login the portal using their mail, (also try to add other form of authentication) to solve those probs 
in given time span...



Write a ranking algorithm to rank the students based on the time consumed, number of probs solved etc.
Try to add a full credit score after each contest.
